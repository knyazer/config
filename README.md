# Knyaz config
*This is a collection of scripts, which I usually use to setup a new system*

## Quickstart
In ```config.sh``` you **MUST** replace the variables with your respective username, real name and email. Former one used to configure pathes, two latter used only for git.

Then you can configure the system the way I like:
```
sudo bash ubuntu_setup.sh
bash ubuntu_zsh_install.sh
```
or, if you do not like zsh, you could run only setup script
```
sudo bash ubuntu_setup.sh
```

This definetely works for Ubuntu 22.04, though supposedly should work for almost any debian-based distro.
